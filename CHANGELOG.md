Magento Functional Testing Framework Changelog
================================================

2.0.1
-----

### Fixes
 * Fixed an issue with `group` annotation.

2.0.0
-----
Changes are compatible with Magento v2.3

### Enhancements
* Modularity
    * Replaced the `<loginAsAdmin>` test action with the action group `LoginAsAdmin`.
    * Added the `.env` file variable `CUSTOM_MODULE_PATHS` which can be used to point to any custom extensions that you may want to write tests against.
    * Added the `<page area="..">` property to distinguish between admin and storefront.
    * Added support for `SectionName.elementName` references in any `function` attributes.
* Customizability
    * Changed page objects where `area="admin"` to prepend the `MAGENTO_BACKEND_NAME` value from the `.env` file.
    * Added support for HTTP requests that do not require authentication.
* Readability
    * Renamed `<config>` XML root nodes to match the content they contain, e.g. `<tests>` or `<pages>`.
    * Renamed all instances of the word *Cest* with *Test*. The *Cest* name will no longer be used in the MFTF project.
* Maintainability
    * Removed the `returnVariable` property from any test actions that return values. Instead, the `stepKey` property will be used as the name of the variable and be referenced as before.

### Fixes
* Fixed the `unselectOption.parameterArray` property to work as expected.
* Fixed a crash if you had a system environment variable set with the same name as any variable in the `.env` file.
* Fixed any actions that refer to *CurrentUrl*, such as `<seeInCurrentUrl>`, to now look at the full webdriver address.
* Fixed the `<waitForPageLoad>` test action to not assume that you always want to dismiss UI notifications.
